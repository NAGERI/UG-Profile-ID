## About the application. 
The flutter application acts as digital profile ID, whereby a user can have all their Identity cards in one.
The User can also upload documents on the app to act as proof, ( of which are uploaded on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and the hash kept on blockchain). 

### NOTE: This is not the final version.

### How to run the Application.
1. Start the local blockchain [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

2. Import the tuffle.config.js file to Ganache workspace.

3. Edit the rpc and ws urls with the one being used by ganache (Probably this should be the WI-FI ) so that they are running on the same network.

4. Start the web Application to enter the data.

5. Start the mobile App and use it.
